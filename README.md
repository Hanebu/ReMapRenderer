# Ultima Online (Re)MapRenderer
An attempt to update, optimize, tidy and make this awesome tool run with modern compilers and tools.<br>
This version works also with High Seas+ Tiledata format and with every MUL map, official and custom.<br>
While the original MapRenderer used SDL 1.1, this "revamp" uses SDL2.<br>
<br>
