# Ultima Online (Re)MapRenderer
This is just an attempt to tidy and make this awesome tool run with modern compilers and tools.<br>
While the original MapRenderer used SDL 1.1, this "revamp" uses SDL1.2 (and in the future it can even be switched to SDL2).<br>
For now, only 32 bits compilation was tested.<br>
<br>

<br>This small tool allows you rendering your favourite Ultima Online Map.
<br>It has been developed for the german freeshard "Welt von Midgard" 
<br>(http://www.welt-von-midgard.de). Maybe you find it useful :)
